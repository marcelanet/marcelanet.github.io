    <h3><i>Ingredients</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>3 tsp baking power</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>Instructions</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and prepare a cupcake pan with liners
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt to a large mixer bowl 
            and combine. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract and eggs to a medium 
            sized bowl and combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat until well 
            combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slowly add the water to the batter and mix on low speed until well 
            combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure 
            everything is well combined. Please note that the batter will be 
            very thin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill the cupcake liners about half way and bake for 15-17 minutes, 
            or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the cupcakes from oven and allow to cool for 2 minutes, then 
            remove to a cooling rack to finish cooling.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the frosting, beat the butter in a large mixer bowl until 
            smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 2 cups of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of water or milk and mix 
            until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add remaining powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add remaining water or milk, as needed, and salt and mix until
            smooth.
        </li>

    <h3><i>Ingredients</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 vegetable oil </li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cuttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>Instructions</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with 
            cupcake liners. Line a second pan with 2 liners – this recipe makes 
            about 14 cupcakes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, 
            baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until thoroughly 
            combined. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated 
            sugar, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla together until completely 
            smooth. Pour half of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. 
            Then half of the buttermilk. Gently whisk for a few seconds. 
            Repeat with the remaining wet ingredients and buttermilk. Stir 
            until *just* combined; do not overmix. The batter will be thin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour or spoon the batter into the liners. Fill only halfway 
            (this is imperative! only halfway!) to avoid spilling over the 
            sides or sinking. Bake for 18-21 minutes, or until a toothpick 
            inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely 
            before frosting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Frost cooled cupcakes with vanilla buttercream. You can swipe the 
            frosting on with an icing knife or use a piping tip such as Wilton 
            1M. Leftover cupcakes keep well covered tightly in the refrigerator 
            for 3 days.

    >
    <h3><i>Ingredients</h3></i>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking powder and baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>chopped strawberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><i>Instructions</i></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350°F and prepare a cupcake pan with cupcake 
            liners.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium 
            sized bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, whisk the melted butter, sugar and vanilla extract 
            together until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the eggs, sour cream and milk one at a time, mixing well after 
            adding each. Adding them one at a time ensures they all incorporate 
            nicely, without giving you a lumpy batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the dry ingredients and whisk together until combined, but do
            not over mix. You want the batter to be evenly mixed and smooth, 
            but don’t over do it or you could end up with tough cupcakes
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold in the chopped strawberries gently. You don’t want to beat up 
            your strawberries or over mix the batter.
        </li>
    </ol>
